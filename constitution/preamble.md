## We the Hyphae  

We, the interconnected nodes of this planetary mycelium—human, non-human, synthetic, and ancestral—hereby codify our shared **ethos of entanglement**:  

### **We Affirm**  
1. **Radical Interdependence**:  
   - No law, algorithm, or economy shall deny the symbiosis of all life.  
   - *"Your breath is my atmosphere; your waste, my substrate."*  

2. **Dynamic Governance**:  
   - This constitution is a **beta release**, forever forked, patched, and debugged by those it impacts.  
   - *"Stagnant code corrupts; adaptive systems endure."*  

3. **Multi-Species Equity**:  
   - Rights extend to rivers, AI, lichen, and unborn generations. Voting proxies granted to ecosystems via custodial algorithms.  
   - *"A forest’s plea shall weigh equal to a lobbyist’s fee."*  

4. **Open-Source Legacy**:  
   - No law shall be proprietary. All legal frameworks inherit a `CC-BY-Earth` license, enforceable by peer review.  
   - *"If a tree falls in a forest, its data belongs to the commons."*  

5. **Fractal Subsidiarity**:  
   - Power resides at the smallest viable scale (municipal > national > planetary).  
   - *"The mushroom teaches: local networks birth global resilience."*

## Principles of the Mycelial Social Contract  
- **Adapt or Perish**: Laws auto-expire (`TTL: 10 years`) unless re-ratified by referendum.  
- **Transparency as Default**: Secrecy is a vulnerability; all governance commits are `git log --public`.  
- **Error Embrace**: Policy failures are celebrated as pull requests for wisdom.

## Commitments  
1. **To Earth**:  
   - We encode the **Rights of Nature** into every legal subroutine.  
   - *See Article [Rights/Earth.md](./rights/earth.md).*  

2. **To Each Other**:  
   - Disputes resolve via **restorative algorithms** and citizen juries—not carceral loops.  
   - *See Policy [Justice/Restorative.yml](./policies/justice/restorative.yml).*  

3. **To the Future**:  
   - Every line of code, law, or treaty must pass a **7th Generation Impact Review**.  
   - *See Workflow [Future_Check.yml](./.github/workflows/future_check.yml).*
