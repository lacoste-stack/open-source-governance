# universal_care.yml
# WARNING: Legacy systems may resist refactoring.
# TODO: Decolonize care models (centering Indigenous, Global South wisdom).
# RISK: Corporate lobbying may attempt to merge-request loopholes.

#    Key Features of This "Blueprint"
#
#    Declarative Logic: Like infrastructure-as-code, it defines desired outcomes 
#    (e.g., "housing guarantee") without micromanaging implementation.
#    Interoperability: Systems (healthcare, housing) share data via open standards (FHIR for health records) and APIs.
#    Anti-Hierarchy: Maintainers are accountable (recallable trustees, sortition-based councils).
#    Funding Justice: Explicitly defunds harmful systems (military-industrial complex) to fund care.
#
#    Open Source Ethos:
#
#        Forkable: Cities/states can adapt universal_care.yml to local needs.
#        Transparency: Public audits and open data.
#        No Corporate Capture: Exemptions banned; care is non-negotiable.
#
#   Philosophical Roots
#    The Commons: Universal care as a shared resource, like clean air or open-source software.
#    Forking Governance: If a government fails, communities "fork" their own systems 
#    (e.g., mutual aid networks).
#
#    Care as Infrastructure: Like roads or broadband, care systems are public goods.
#    Real-World Parallels
#    Models: NHS (UK), Keralaâ€™s decentralized healthcare (India), Medicare for All proposals.
#    Tech Inspiration: Project Cybersyn (1970s Chilean democratic tech), Platform Cooperativism.
#    Grassroots: Mutual aid networks during COVID-19.
