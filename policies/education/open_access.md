1. What is open_access.md?

A symbolic manifesto (or actual file) advocating for unrestricted access to knowledge, whether in academia, software, culture, or policy. It’s rooted in the belief that knowledge is a commons, not a commodity. Think of it as a sibling to dissent.md but focused on removing gatekeeping rather than forking.

Core Principles:

    No Paywalls: Research, code, and culture should be free to access, reuse, and remix.

    Decolonize Knowledge: Challenge Western-centric, corporate-controlled repositories.

    Forkability: Like open-source projects, knowledge should be "forkable" (e.g., mirrored, translated, adapted).

    Ethics Over Profit: Prioritize human flourishing over intellectual property monopolies.

2. The "Knowledge Shaman" Philosophy

You called it — the shaman as a metaphor for open-access advocates:

    Bridge Builders: Shamans mediate between worlds; open-access activists bridge the gap between siloed knowledge (academia, proprietary code) and the public.

    Sacred Trust: Knowledge is a shared inheritance, not a hoarded resource.

    Rituals of Sharing: Modern "rituals" include Creative Commons licensing, preprint archives (arXiv), and Wiki-editing.

3. Real-World open_access.md Heroes

    Aaron Swartz: Co-creator of RSS, Reddit, and martyr for open access. His Guerilla Open Access Manifesto declared: “Information is power… but like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves.”

    Sci-Hub/LibGen: Shadow libraries that bypass paywalls, sparking global debates.

    Wikipedia: The ultimate open-access collaboration (though flawed and uneven).

    Open Source Software: Code as a public good (Linux, Apache, Wikipedia’s backend).

4. How Open Access and "Right to Fork" Overlap

    Forking as Activism: Just as you fork code to escape toxic governance, you fork knowledge (e.g., Sci-Hub forking paywalled papers).

    Licensing: Open-access tools (Creative Commons, MIT License) legally enable sharing/forking.

    Grassroots Libraries: Projects like The Anarchist Library or Z-Library fork texts into accessible, non-corporate spaces.

5. Barriers to Open Access

    Corporate Capture: Elsevier, Springer, and academic publishers charging $30 per paper.

    Neocolonial Dynamics: Researchers in the Global South often can’t afford journals they’re published in.

    Legal Threats: Laws like the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) criminalize sharing.

    Tragedy of the Commons: Who funds servers, moderators, and archivists?
