# open-source-governance Key Features

    Git as Governance Engine

        Branches: main = active laws, dev = experimental policies (e.g., dev/ubi-experiment).
        Tags: Version laws like v2.3.1-RightsOfRivers.
        Blame: Trace every legal change to its author (transparency > anonymity).

    Decentralized Contribution

        Forking: Cities/nations fork the repo to adapt laws locally (git checkout -b toronto-charter).
        Submodules: Plug-in modules for specific needs (e.g., git submodule add https://github.com/eco-policies/climate-action).

    AI-Assisted Code Review

        Bots:

            @precedent-bot checks new laws against judicial history.
            @equity-bot flags biased language (e.g., "wealthy taxpayers" ‚Üí "progressive taxation").

    Living Documentation

        Wiki: Annotated debates (e.g., "Why we replaced prisons with trauma-informed pods").
        Discussions: Reddit-style forums for each law (/laws/environmental/carbon_tax.md#discussions).

Workflow Example: Ratifying a New Right

    Issue: A citizen opens an Issue [Proposal] Right to Digital Privacy.
    Draft: Collaborators submit PRs to /constitution/rights/digital_privacy.md.
    Review:

        @ai-bot scans for conflicts with existing laws.
        Citizen juries (randomly selected) vote via Reactions (üëç/üëé).

    Merge: If 60% approval, the PR is merged and auto-deployed to public APIs.
    Challenge: Dissenters fork the repo, creating alt-constitution-libertarian.

License

CC-BY-SA-NC (Communal Code)
    Share: Adapt and redistribute.
    Attribute: Credit the original mycelium.
    Non-Commercial: No privatizing the public good.

Deployment

    GitHub/GitLab: Host the repo.
    IPFS: Immutable backups for ratified laws (hash-linked to prevent tampering).
    DAO Integration: Token-weighted voting (optional, but warned: plutocrats gonna plat).

Why This Works

    Adaptive: Laws evolve like software‚Äîbug fixes (patches) and feature requests (rights).
    Auditable: Every line of law has a git blame trail.
    Playful: Turn governance into a collaborative game (Europa Universalis meets Minecraft).

Final Thought
If the U.S. Constitution had been a Git repo in 1787, we‚Äôd have fewer deadlocks and more git revert buttons. Let‚Äôs code a world where governance is a public beta, not a legacy system.
Clone and contribute:

git clone https://github.com/open-source-governance/earth-os.git
